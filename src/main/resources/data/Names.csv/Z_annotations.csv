1,"GR0241","GR0241","Unnamed Location","7/21/99","MILS REF. NO.","The MILS number assigned to this property was incorrect.  It was reassigned to the Humboldt Prospect (GR-274) when this quadrangle was revised in 1992.",
2,"HA0359","HA0358","Arkoosh Group","3/03/99","Location","Moore (1909 IMIR, p. 29-30) says this is a new discovery for the previous year and locates it in the granodiorite about 3/4 mile southeast of the Croesus and directly between the Croesus and the Minnie Moore.  Umpleby and others (1930) show a Galena claim in about the correct location (Plate 9, No. 71).  Since Moore discribes the ""Magnificent galena ore shoot"" on the Arkoosh property, this claim seems a ""best guess"" for the location, pending other information.  (George Arkoosh owned the Comet and black Jack (or Jacket) Groups in the 1920s; it is not known if this property is the Black Jack Group).",

4,"SA0180","SA0180","Marguerite Prospect","9/11/00","Synonym","Savage (1967, CR-6) links the Marguerite (an older name) with the Bonner Mining Company (or ""Bonner Prospect"" of Anderson, 1930 (IBMG B-12)).  Relative ages of the names comes from information in the property files.",
5,"SA0291","SA0291","Bumble Bee Prospect","8/18/00","Synonym","The ""Middle Mountain Copper Mining & Milling Company"" synonym is from an old prospect that was in the vicinity of the Bumble Bee.  Anderson (1930) states the Bumble Bee is an old prospect that had beren restaked a number of times (by 1927); therefore, it is probable that the Middle Mountain M&M Co. was one of the earlier owners of this property.  Rueben Johnson was the president of Middle Mountain, and the Bumble Bee is on Johnson Creek and on the flanks of Johnson Peak.",
6,"SA043","SA042","Unnamed prospect","1/19/99","Name","From the description in Brackebusch (1969), this prospect was probably part of the American Girl property.",

8,"WL0236a","WL0236","Silver Rock","2/18/99","Name","This Silver Rock is a recent property and is not equivalent to the ""Silver Rock"" mentioned in the 1912 IMIR (p. 180).",
9,"WL0445","WL0445","Central Prospect","3/08/99","Production","Part of the production reported for the Atlas Mine (WL-446) probably came from this part of the Atlas property.",
10,"WL0446","WL0446","Little Giant","3/08/99","Production","All the production for the Atlas Mine is reported under this part of the mine, but the total includes ore mined from the Central (WL-445) and Carbonate Hill (WL-448) parts of the Atlas property.",
11,"WL0448","WL0448","Carbonate Hill","3/08/99","Production","Part of the production reported for the Atlas Mine (WL 446) apparently came from this part of the Atlas property.",
12,"WL0481","WL0481","Taylor Copper Mine","8/05/99","All","It is suspected this property is acctually either the Copper Chief or the Bullion.  For many years, James H. Taylor was secretary, manager, statutory agent, and/or major stockholder in both companies.  W.R. Taylor was president of the Bullion Mining Company from 1948 to 1952.  The only information on the Taylor property os a USBM mineral property file with a location of dubious accuracy (precision of 10 kilometers).",
13,"WL0500","WL0500","Alpina Prospect","8/13/99","Deposit/Reference","""Bald Mountain Ledge"" is listed as a synonym.  This is from USGS B-285.  The deposit description and workings correspond better to the Alpina than the Alice (WL 501), although Collier's map and location information seem to indicate the Alice.  The Alpina is mentioned by Collier as another property on which development is taking place, but it is believed that the inclusion of ""Alpina"" here is because the name was accidentally substituted for ""Alice.""",
14,"WL0500a","WL0500","Alpina Prospect","8/13/99","All","This line is the MILS entry for the ""Bald Mountain Prospect.""  Collier (1906, USGS B-285) describes a ""Bald Mountain Ledge"" which more or less matches the USGS B-540 description of the Alpina.  Calkins and Jones (1914, USGS B-540) describes a ""Bald Mountain"" property which is clearly across the line in Montana.  The geology and other features of the two properties are quite dissimilar.",
15,"WL0501","WL0501","Alice Prospect","8/13/99","Deposit/Reference","The property described in USGS B-285 appears, from the map and location information to be the Allice, but the deposit description and workings correspond more closely to those of the Alpina (WL-500).  Collier mentions the Alpina as another property where development is in progress, but this is believe to be a mistake in the names (and should have read ""Alice."")",
16,"CH1202","CH1202","Rob-Roy Mine","10/13/2004","location","This site probably includes both the adits marked on the map by the location in the database and the open stopes mapped by Dave Leppert for the BLM under Ginna Gillerman's project.",
17,"CH1204","CH1204","Carrothers-Hines","10/13/2004","location","Despite the different USBM file numbers, this property is likely the same as the Rob Roy (CH1202), which was owned by Ed Hinze of Clayton, Idaho.  Try to find sorces to prove or disprove this.",

McHugh and other (1991), citing Tuchek and Ridenour (1981), put the location in the same place as IF-73 (which is an unnamed site shown on the topo map).
