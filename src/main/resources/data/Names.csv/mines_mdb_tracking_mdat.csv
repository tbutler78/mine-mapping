18,"1.2015.1","The NEWLOC field will be retained in the Mines table in the new database.  A sort of the MAPLOC field in the Mines table was done to isolate other properties with incomplete spatial data, name data, or designated 'deleted'. These were moved to the TrackChanges table as well, and deleted from the Mines and MineIndex tables.","20141110","See proc_date","CAT"
19,"1.2015.1","During development of the database subscripts were used to designate properties that may have been related spatially to a common point location, or as a placer. At this time the consensus at IGS is that these artifacts have either been resolved or cannot be determined, and the subscripts are not necessary. With one exception the only subscripted properties in the Mines table were designated as placer and have a corresponding SequentialNumber.","20141110","See proc_date","CAT"
20,"1.2015.1","The placer entries were deleted and recorded in the TrackChange table in the event of development of a searchable placer table. All subscripted entries in the MineIndex table, the table that drives the web interface, were deleted without being entered into TrackChange. A previous version of the Mines and Prospects database will have to be consulted (ex. 1.2011.3) to refer to these obsolete entries.","20141110","See proc_date","CAT"
21,"1.2015.1","Substantial upcomming changes to the database:   Property location will done using the smallest verifiable areal extent for property location. This may be a point within a margin of error,   a mining district, or a county. NOTE:  As of the version MinesAndProspects_1.2015.1, properties located only to mining district or county   have not been re-introduced into the database.  A verification process for property location is in place. As references are checked or updated, it will be noted in the TrackChange table and the property location will be refined, kept the same, or deleted as needed. Changes to property references will aslo be noted in TrackChanges.   It may be useful to consult the metadata concerning the origins and history of this database to understand the rational behind these current   changes.  Database will be generally updated at least once daily while work is being done. These versions can be referenced by the date logs below. Protocol is to copy the current database into the Previous Versions folder and append 'backup' to the date and time stamp, and work in the current database.","20141110","See proc_date","CAT"
22,"1.2015.1","The Mines table contained a number of properties not represented in the MinesIndex table. Some of these properties were gathered during field work for the Abandoned Mines project, others are of unknown origin. The HardFile? and LocationUpdated? fields were automatically populated with '0' when these properties were added to the MinesIndex table. These properties were added to the TrackChange table as well. These will have to be revisited and references added etc. as they are researched. The Ore, MinesLookup, Deposit-Seperated, ProdValues, ProdValue, ProductionValues, and PLSS_Tools tables were found to have subscripted   properties. These subscripted entries were removed from these tables. Mines and MineIndex tables were rectified to build 1 to 1 relationship based on  SequenceNumber. MineMaps table created and brought into database. MineMapLUT created using Python tools to map additional properties associated with maps, and brought into database.","20141112-13","See proc_date","CAT"

24,"1.2015.1","Reverted to a copy of the 20141113 database to be CURRENT, so take care if digging in any databases after that and before 20141118. Appended   the MineMaps table to PropertyFileScans table, rectified all problems, and successfully linked the the new PropertyFileScans to Mines. To   reflect the changes that were necessary in the CURRENT database, the working spreadsheets were updated, as well as the .pdf folder of   available mine maps, the back up of .tiff mine map scans, and the ancillary repositories of scans (such as the 'M:\Property_files\X-Not   Ready For Prime Time\Mine Maps\1Rescan_OR_needCataloged_OR_mapScan_notFound' folders). No new information was added to TrackChange since no   properties were modified.","20141117","See proc_date","CAT"
25,"1.2015.1","Rectified problems with MineMapsLUT against properties in MinesIndex. Appended to ScanCrossRef table and updated FINAL Mine map spreadsheets   as needed. Deleted redundant or expired tables and queries used in DB update process. Updated Maps T/F checkbox in PropertyFileScans to   'True' for appended mine map entries (this was not a field added before the append). Updated the 'PropertyFileScans subform USE THIS ONE' to   include the searchable Year category and the mining company name. Deleted the Maps T/F category because it was redundant ('map' is a unique   category in ItemType). Deleted the PropertyName field since this is contained in the Mines table. Updated field descriptions for the   PropertyFileScans table. Institiuted  Referential Integrity, Cascade Update, and Cascade Delete from Mines to MineIndex, PropertyFileScans, and ScanCrossRef.

27,"1.2015.1","Isolated properties in Mines that have no WGS84. Discovered properties that have hard files without web representation (will have to physically verify those files and update MinesIndex appropriately at a later date). Properties that had DD or DMS information were brought into ArcGIS 10.2.2, projected to WGS84, and then appended back onto the Mines table. Properties with no geographical reference were deleted and noted in TrackChange.","20141119","See proc_date","CAT"
28,"1.2015.1","Updated MinesIndex to reflect the properties above where hard files exist. Brought several properties back to the Mines table that had been deleted because of NEWLOC, but had distinct lat/lon. Projected into WGS84 as above. Made notes in the 'Problems' field to check references and other table dependencies (other than MinesIndex, which was updated to reflect Mines). Downloaded the latest PLSS data from the BLM for Idaho, and used it to derive TRS1/4 sections for the 8838 properties in the database. Some areas of Idaho have not been surveyed, so  some properties cannot be assigned a 1/4 section. However, a quater section was assigned. NW if the section had no quarter sections, and SE if half of the section had quarter sections but the property fell inside the half section without quarters. Created a new table to reflect this data and labled it TRSQ_Mines. Of course a  disclaimer will have to be put up on the website noting this. After the DB overhaul is designed and complete the LUT dependencies will be resolved and updated.","20141201","See proc_date","CAT"
29,"1.2015.1","Removed tables, queries, and forms that were no longer of use. Some of these are retained in a new database named Database51_DefunctTables.   Backups of the current database before this date will have these artifacts in tact. Updated Mines with best available PLSS, however, EC1309 and HM0263 (both new properties) will have to have this information added later.  NOTE:  HM0263 and EC1509 need all attributes entered. They exist only as SeqNum in Mines and WGS84 lat/lon. This can happen after the database is handed over and moves to live updates, and will wait till then.   Updated the 24k and 100k Quads using IGS shapefiles and Mines WGS84 points used for setting up the TSRQ fields. Projected the quads into WGS84, did an Identify, and pulled the table into Access where an update query was done to add the information.","20141204","See proc_date","CAT"
30,"1.2015.1","Deleted the Region field in Mines. Updated the MinesIndex table for the Scanned field to be 'False.'

31,"1.2015.1","Changed Location_type field type in Mines table to Number. Used update query to change Null fields to '0'.","20141211","See proc_date","CAT"
