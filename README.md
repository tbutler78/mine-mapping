Multiple underscores in words

"Normal" Markdown transforms underscores (_) into italics, such that wow_great_stuff becomes wowgreatstuff.

It is not reasonable to italicize just part of a word, especially when you're dealing with code and names often appear with multiple underscores. Therefore, GFM ignores multiple underscores in words.

perform_complicated_task
do_this_and_do_that_and_another_thing

becomes

perform_complicated_task
do_this_and_do_that_and_another_thing
URL autolinking

GFM will autolink standard URLs, so if you want to link to a URL (instead of setting link text), you can simply enter the URL and it will be turned into a link to that URL.

http://example.com

becomes

http://example.com
Strikethrough

GFM adds syntax to create strikethrough text, which is missing from standard Markdown.

~~Mistaken text.~~

becomes

Mistaken text.
Fenced code blocks

Standard Markdown converts text with four spaces at the beginning of each line into a code block; GFM also supports fenced blocks. Just wrap your code in ``` (as shown below) and you won't need to indent it by four spaces. Note that although fenced code blocks don't have to be preceded by a blank line—unlike indented code blocks—we recommend placing a blank line before them to make the raw Markdown easier to read.

Here's an example:

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```

Keep in mind that, within lists, you must indent non-fenced code blocks eight spaces to render them properly.
Syntax highlighting

Code blocks can be taken a step further by adding syntax highlighting. In your fenced block, add an optional language identifier and we'll run it through syntax highlighting. For example, to syntax highlight Ruby code:

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

We use Linguist to perform language detection and syntax highlighting. You can find out which keywords are valid by perusing the languages YAML file.
Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell

For aesthetic purposes, you can also add extra pipes on the ends:

| First Header  | Second Header |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |
| Content Cell  | Content Cell  |

Note that the dashes at the top don't need to match the length of the header text exactly:

| Name | Description          |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Help      | Display the help window.|
| Close     | Closes a window     |

You can also include inline Markdown such as links, bold, italics, or strikethrough:

| Name | Description          |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Help      | ~~Display the~~ help window.|
| Close     | _Closes_ a window     |

Finally, by including colons : within the header row, you can define text to be left-aligned, right-aligned, or center-aligned:

| Left-Aligned  | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |
| :------------ |:---------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | some wordy text | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered        |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat        |    $1 |

A colon on the left-most side indicates a left-aligned column; a colon on the right-most side indicates a right-aligned column; a colon on both sides indicates a center-aligned column.
